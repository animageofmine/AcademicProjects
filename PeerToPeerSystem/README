CC FILES
1) sv_node.cc 
This file has the functionality to receive all the messages and send the messages. It has functionality to write to the log file too.  
2) commandLine.cc
This file is the client part of the program which accepts input from the user
3) file.cc
this file has functions to write to the log file
4) hello.cc
This file has the functionality to parse the hello message
5) iniparser.c
This file parses the *.ini file submitted by the user
6) linklist_beacons.cc
This file creates a linked list which contains all the ini parameters
7) message_cache.cc
This file has functionality for the message cache
8) message_header.cc
This file creates and parses the header of each message
9) neighbor_list.cc
This file creates a linked list of all the neighbors of a non beacon node 
10) socket_list.cc
This file has the functionality to implement a linked list and contains data of all the connections related to a particular node
11) timer.cc
This file has the functionality to send keep alive message to all the neighbor nodes and checks whether a neighbor node is sending keep alive message on time
